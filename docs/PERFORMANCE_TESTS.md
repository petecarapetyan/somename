- imports directly and immediately as a maven project
- pom file is written properly and not mis named or otherwise
- includes at least one junit test case
- absolute minimum amount of slowdown on git, git tooling, IDE and IDE tooling
- emphasize the corporate standard setup
- example projects should be each of invisible, runnable, and present with the assignment
- remove as many infrastructure/tooling obstacles from coding assignments:
- teach coding
- or teach tooling/setup
