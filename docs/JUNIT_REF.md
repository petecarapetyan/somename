# JUnit Reference

This project includes a JUnit 5 (Jupiter) coding example fully runnable as a part of it's source.

## JUnit is NOT Required

The student may completely ignore junit testing as a part of this assignment!

The JUnit examples and or your own junit tests are NOT a required part of this assignment.

Instead, this is here only as a fallback, for students who lose track of their progress within the assignment, and wish to add a junit test with the guidance of the instructor, to keep them on the glide path to success on this assignment.
